## Why Echolog

## Protect yourself

There are three main ways to protect yourself from getting your IP being pulled, these are sorted from a quick fix to extreme measures.

- **Extensions**: Using different extensions you can most of these IP loggers. I would recommend installing [NoScript](https://noscript.net/), [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/), and [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/). These are all good extensions that keep you safe online.
- **VPN**: Using a VPN service can hide your IP address and encrypt your internet traffic. If you would like to try a VPN, I recommend surfshark, get a sweet discount [with this referral link](https://surfshark.club/friend/gFRhb6Dq). You get a free month and I get a free month, it is a win win.
- **Web Proxy** Using a web proxy service can also hide your IP address and encrypt your internet traffic. You can find proxies by searching up "web proxy" on a search engine.
- **Tor**: Using the Tor browser is the ultimate way, it masks your IP address and encrypts your internet traffic through a series of servers. You will notice that speed are much slower than normal, but if you are getting targeted constantly, this should do it.
- **No internet**: Hey they can't IP log you if you don't have a IP to log :)

All of these depend on you and how much you are willing to sacrifice for privacy, but for most people getting extensions like Noscript and uBlock Origin should do you enough.

## Getting started

This project uses [wtfismyip](https://wtfismyip.com/) as a base to collect the IP, but you can use any API that returns the information you want, you just have to update the `echolog` object to handle it. 

You can look in the [`tests`](tests) folder for examples on how to implent this into your own project.
